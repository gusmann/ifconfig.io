[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/georgyo/ifconfig.io/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/georgyo/ifconfig.io/latest)

Inspired by ifconfig.me, but designed for pure speed. A single server can do 18,000 requests per seconds while only consuming 50megs of ram.

## Short Summary

I used the gin framework as it does several things to ensure that there are no memory allocations on each request, keeping the GC happy and preventing unnessary allocations.

Tested to handle 10,000 clients doing 90,000 requests persecond on modest hardware with an average response time of 42ms. Easily servicing over 5 million requests in a minute. (Updated June, 2022)

## Deployment

You can use the source code directly to deploy your own server. You can also use Docker and Docker Compose.

### Docker-Compose

Here is a sample docker-compose file:

``` bash
version: "3.4"

services:
  ifconfig:
    image: georgyo/ifconfig.io
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
```

Some other compose files:

``` bash
version: "3.4"

services:
  ifconfig:
    image: georgyo/ifconfig.io
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    environment:
      HOSTNAME: "ifconfig.io"
```

``` bash
version: "3.4"

services:
  ifconfig:
    image: georgyo/ifconfig.io
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    env_file:
      - ./.env
```

### ENVs

This project offers you some customizability over what you show to user and ect. Here is list of all possible environment variable that you can pass to your instance, with their default values.

``` bash
HOSTNAME="ifconfig.io" # Text address shown to user at header
CMD_PROTOCOL="" # Request protocol for curl commands
HOST=""
PORT="8080"
PROXY_PROTOCOL_ADDR=""
FORWARD_IP_HEADER="CF-Connecting-IP" # Request header to get IP from
COUNTRY_CODE_HEADER="CF-IPCountry" # Request header to get country code from
TLS="0"
TLSPORT="8443"
TLSCERT="/opt/ifconfig/.cf/ifconfig.io.crt"
TLSKEY="/opt/ifconfig/.cf/ifconfig.io.key"
```
